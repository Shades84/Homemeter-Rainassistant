# Homemeter-Rainassistant
A Home Assistant control and status suite for Rainmeter

What's New:
* User defined on state colors. Now, every icon starts out as a white icon and has a tint applied to it
* Vertical sensor bar graph variant 
* Created a (somewhat) comprehensive installation and troubleshooting guide.
* Actually uploaded the media player skin (forgot to do that somehow last time)

This is my first project that i've opened up to the community, and im still working out a lot of the kinks in my workflow. And also, improving my coding style. I appreciate people being patient. Message me here or on reddit if you are having issues.

What's Next:
* Actually making the music player better


## Quick Start Guide
See the full installation guide for more details

Requires curl. Get it from [here](https://curl.se/windows/). I downloaded this and moved the contents of the 'bin' folder to a new 'curl' folder in a convient place. You need to add curl to your windows path. Check the instructions [here](https://develop.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001068567-Installing-and-using-cURL/) for a good guide

Requires Rainmeter-JsonParser plugin to be installed. ([here](https://github.com/e2e8/rainmeter-jsonparser))

Load the "settings" skin to change your 
* Home Assistant address
* Home Assistant Authentication Token. Instructions [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/)
* Refresh rate (higher refreshes more often, but might cause more cpu/network usage)
* Icon color scheme and size 
* Icon highlight (this is the color the button shows when the state is 'on')
* Text and background color options


Enjoy!
